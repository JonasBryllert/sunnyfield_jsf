know_2_details=The house is located at the top of Rath Lane but according to the town land map this area is called Boggyheary, Kilsallaghan.
know_3_header=The driveway and paving was done one year later
know_3_details=It took an additional three year before the gate was installed. But it is a sure thing that no gate or an open gate makes for more people stopping by!
know_4_header=220 beech trees were planted in the north side hedge.
know_4_details=The hedge had a tough start. First winter the hares bit of pretty much every tree only about a foot of the ground. A fence was erected. It is since coming back well on the drier west side but unfortunately as it gets wetter many trees have died. The plan is to replace with Hornbeam.
